## Rebuilt Features

Color Palette, Layout and Tasks
Mobile, Tablet and Desktop

## Dependencies

Uses CSS3 and HTML5 latest features. Be sure to prefix any bleeding-edge rules, tags, etc (see [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/) for reference). Also using latest ES6/next, you should probably think about including [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for transpilation (or an NPM script).
